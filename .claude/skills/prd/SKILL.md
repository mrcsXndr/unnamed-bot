# /prd — Start a PRD

Usage: `/prd <domain>` — `domain` matches one of the user's configured domains (work company, side project, etc.). Templates live in `templates/`; if none exist, scaffold one on first run and tell the user.

## Steps

1. **Locate the template**:
   - Look in `templates/prd_<domain>.md`. If not found, generate a generic PRD template at `templates/prd_default.md` and use that.
   - Read the corresponding `context/<domain>.md` so the doc starts grounded in the project.

2. **Ask the user for the PRD title** (keep it short — slug-friendly).

3. **Copy template** to `projects/<Domain>/PRDs/<title-slug>.md`. Pre-fill:
   - Date (today)
   - Author (the user's name from `context/me.md`)
   - Status: `Draft`

4. **Walk through each section**, prompting the user for input. Keep questions specific — don't dump the whole template at once.

5. **Domain-specific guards**: if the domain has constraints documented in its context file (regulatory, security, accessibility, performance budgets), surface them before the user picks a solution. That's the whole reason we read the context file first.

## Generic PRD shape

If you need to scaffold a default template, use:

```markdown
# [Title]

**Author:** [Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status:** Draft
