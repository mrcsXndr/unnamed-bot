# /weekly — Weekly Review

Run on Friday afternoon (or Sunday evening — whatever rhythm fits) to close the loop on the week.

## Steps

1. **Per-domain summary** — for each domain listed in `CLAUDE.md` (work / side-project / personal):
   - Recent commits / merged PRs across the relevant repos (`git log --since="7 days ago"`)
   - Tickets closed (GitHub / GitLab / Linear)
   - Tasks marked done in Google Tasks or the task-board sheet
   - Notable decisions captured in memory or context docs

2. **Meeting recap** — summarise this week's standup / one-to-one / weekly meeting notes from wherever you save them (`meetings/dev/`, `meetings/mgmt/`, etc.).

3. **Tracker reconciliation** — for each tracker the user keeps, list items currently in flight, blocked, or overdue. Use `python tools/state_track.py status <project>` if you've set that up.

4. **Ask the user to fill in the gaps:**
   - Energy this week (1–5)
   - Biggest blocker
   - One thing to drop next week
   - Top three priorities for next week

5. **Save** to `meetings/weekly/YYYY-Www.md` (ISO week number — `date +%G-W%V`). Future-you will appreciate the consistent naming.

## Optional: highlight reel

If the user wants a short version to share (in Slack, with their manager, on a personal blog), generate a 4-line bullet list at the top: shipped, learned, blocked, next.
