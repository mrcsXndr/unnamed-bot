"""Shared session-id resolver for the v2 context channels.

Why this exists
---------------
The architecture docs tell the Director to run e.g.
`journal.py append "$SESSION_ID" ...`, but `$SESSION_ID` is not exported
into the Director's per-call shells. When the Director can't resolve it,
it passes the literal string "unknown" — which lands every write in
`memory/sessions/unknown/`, defeating the per-session model.

The session-start hook writes the real Claude Code `session_id` to
`.claude/.current_session_id`. This resolver lets journal/timeline/critic
fall back to that marker whenever the caller's arg is missing, empty, or
"unknown", so writes land in the correct per-session directory even when
the Director doesn't have the id to hand.
