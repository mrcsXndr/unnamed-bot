"""Sanitize a memory chunk before it is injected into the session prompt.

Thin gate over tools/sanitize.py (does NOT reimplement sanitization). Reads a
chunk from stdin, runs sanitize.scan + sanitize.full_sanitize, and decides:

  - HIGH / CRITICAL risk  -> emit a [BLOCKED: ...] marker instead of the chunk
                             (Hermes block-on-poison) — UNLESS --no-block is
                             passed (curated MEMORY.md: clean but don't block).
  - otherwise             -> emit the cleaned chunk (invisible-unicode stripped,
                             HIGH/CRITICAL patterns neutralised, NOT framed).

Usage (stdin -> stdout):
  sanitize_chunk.py <source-label> [--no-block]

STRICTLY FAIL-OPEN: if sanitize.py can't be imported/run, this prints the raw
chunk unchanged and a one-line note to stderr, exiting 0. The SessionStart hook
must never break.
