"""health_sweep.py — one zero-LLM pass over every health signal on this box.

The supervisor tick already RUNS the monitors, and those alert the OPERATOR.
This sweep is the read side for the BOT: it aggregates every signal into
PASS/FAIL lines the director can act on, so a self-check prompts a fix instead
of only producing another notification nobody reads.

    PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/v2/health_sweep.py          # report
    ... --json                                                      # JSON out

Built-in checks:
  tg-poller       tg_watchdog --probe-only     (409 = ALIVE is the good state)
  supervisor      supervisor.log fresh          (< 10 min; 3-min ticks)
  disk            free space on the repo's volume (FAIL under 10 GB)
  browser-orphans leftover headless Chrome processes (> 6 = a leak)

Add your own to CHECKS. A check is a zero-argument callable returning
`(ok: bool, detail: str)`; anything it raises is caught and reported as a FAIL,
so one broken check can never take the sweep down with it.

Exit code is ALWAYS 0. This is a report, not a gate — FAIL lines carry enough
detail to act on and the director owns the fixing.

## Give a check a budget that matches what it measures

The single most valuable line in this file is the timeout argument to `run()`,
and it is the one that gets guessed. Measure the thing first, then set the
budget above its worst observed run, not near its median.

Observed on the original of this file: a monitor that walks a few hundred
remote resources has a median runtime of ~370 s and a tail past 670 s. The
supervisor that invokes it allowed 1200 s, with a comment recording that an
earlier 180 s budget "would have killed a HEALTHY run every single hour". This
sweep was then written with 300 s — below the median — and reported
`FAIL … monitor unreadable (exit=-1)` on a perfectly healthy monitor, on every
single run, for weeks.

Two lessons worth keeping, because neither is obvious in the moment:

  - **A check that always fails is worse than no check.** It does not sit
    there being ignored; it teaches you to skim past the one line that
    matters, and it hides the real failure when it finally arrives.
  - **A timeout must not report as a crash.** "unreadable (exit=-1)" is what a
    too-short budget looked like for as long as the bug lived, and it reads as
    "the tool is broken" rather than "the budget is wrong" — which is why it
    survived so long. `TIMED_OUT` is a distinct code for exactly that reason;
    give the operator the sentence that names the budget.

When two places bound the same external tool, say in a comment which one is
authoritative, so a future divergence has an answer already written down.
